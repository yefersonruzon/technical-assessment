# My technical evaluation for wizybot

Hello, my name is yeferson ruzon and for this technical test I followed the requirements to the letter both in architecture, technical requirements and technologies to be used with an extra design so you can see more of my layout skills.



## Installation
 

Install and run my project with npm

```bash
  npm install
  npm run dev
```


## Highlights

- Delete chat button due to the use of session storage to keep messages and recommendations. 

- Everything outside of the technical test (chatbot) is just responsive design with no interactions.

- Use of both Css and tailwind to demonstrate skills .

- use of static pricing since the api provided did not have pricing.


Thank you for the opportunity to showcase my skills, I look forward to hearing about the position att. yeferson ruzon
